- Worked as the sole developer on the containerization of a legacy high-performance 3D application using Docker to improve portability and bring the project closer to being production-ready
- Developed multiple Bash/Shell scripts, streamlining and automating the process of generating synthetic data, to train a convolutional neural network for the classification of airplanes in satellite imagery
- Debugged complex C++ build systems and solved multiple device driver issues to enable performing graphical operations in a virtual environment. The Docker image I created is now being used as the basis for production
